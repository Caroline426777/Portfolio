                        Every year the Dutch Design Week takes place in Eindhoven. This is a big design event where
                        designers present their work and ideas. DDW focuses mainly on the future of design and promotes
                        young talents who want to get involved here. The focus of the DDW event is on experimentation,
                        innovation, and crossover.<br>
                        For this year’s Dutch Design Week, Fontys offers its visitors an immersive and personalized,
                        data-driven experience in their ICT InnovationLab. For this project, we Deltas had the task of
                        brainstorming and coming up with an idea for DDW's immersive building experience. The main theme
                        was interactive building and we had to come up with concepts that had to do with emotions and/or
                        memories.

                    <p>This Dutch Design Week we are not working alone. The companies Hyper Culture and Studio Krom are
                        working and assisting this project as well. <b>Hyper Culture</b> is a designer-director duo
                        based in the Netherlands. For the DDW Fontys projects, they have made an unique branding that
                        will tie everything together.
                        <br><b>Studio Krom</b> is a design studio that explores the possibilities of new media. They
                        have advised us on our ideas and concepts throughout the project and have helped us developing
                        our interactive installations.

                        When coming up with concepts, we had to think about the question, “How does the building see
                        you?”. After a series of iterations, I combined two of my concepts into one.<br>
                        The first concept is called <b>"Material Faces”</b>. In this case the building sees the visitors
                        as a
                        reflection of itself, as a face with different materials and textures. On the face of the
                        visitor, different building materials and textures will appear, that make up the features of the
                        face. The type of materials and colors that the visitors see were based on the emotion the
                        visitor feels, this is measured through emotion detection.
                        <br><br>
                        The second concept is called <b>“Emotional Warmth”</b>. The building sees you as body heat. It
                        can
                        recognize the visitor’s emotion and shows them the visitors body heat. Every emotion will look
                        different, because when feeling different emotions, people will feel warm and cold spots on
                        different parts of the body.

                    <p class="ps-lg-8 pe-lg-8 ps-xl-10 pe-xl-10">
                        This is the combination of the two concepts mentioned above, the final product. The visitor is
                        detected with object tracking by the building. De building will show the visitor a reflection of
                        itself by making the visitor’s body into an abstract shape with different materials and
                        textures. There are multiple abstract shape compositions that represent one of four emotions.
                        These compositions have different materials, textures, way of moving and feels to them. When the
                        visitor stands in front of the big screen, the building will assign one composition to the
                        visitor. It is up to the visitor to figure out the emotion.
